This function adds the curve specified by the stack arguments 2: and 1:.

2: x-axis specification
1: y-axis specification

The x-axis specification is typically a vector or an interval.
The y-axis specification can be either a vector or an algebraic formula with a
single independent variable, typically ùë•.

Invoking this multiple times will for each time generate a new
curve on the same canvas.  The last curve generated is referred to
as the current curve.  The user can invoke `casual--graph-juggle'
to rotate to an arbitrary curve to make it current.

The number of sample points used to plot a curve can be set by
calling `casual--graph-num-points'."

  ;; because it separates axis components into separate data structures. Ideally
